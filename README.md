# Wildfire_Prediction
My final project predicting wildfires in Australia. All data are taken and modified from https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/spot-challenge-wildfires/
You can download the data from the aforementioned link and put it in the same directory as the jupyter notebook to run the code yourself.
